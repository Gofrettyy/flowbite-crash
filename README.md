## Introduction

Flowbite is a Tailwind CSS component library that extends Tailwind's utility-first approach by providing pre-designed components and templates. It simplifies the process of building web interfaces by offering ready-to-use UI components, such as navigation bars, cards, forms, and more, styled with Tailwind CSS classes. Flowbite complements Tailwind CSS by accelerating the development of web projects through its collection of customizable and reusable components.
